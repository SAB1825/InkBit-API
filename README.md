## 🚀 Getting Started

Inkbit is currently in **beta** and offers a simple and secure way to manage BLOGS through organizations and API keys.

### 🔐 Step 1: Create an Organization

Start by creating an organization via the provided API.
This step will return an `API key` specific to that organization.

### 🗝️ Step 2: Authenticate with API Key

Use the generated API key in all future requests by adding it to your headers:

```
x-api-key: <your-api-key>
```

This is required for all protected endpoints.
